 “This policy is written by a surplus lines insurer and is not subject to the filing or approval
requirements of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. Such a policy may contain
conditions, limitations, exclusions and different terms than a policy issued by an insurer granted a
Certificate of Authority by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. The insurer has
been approved by the Department as an eligible surplus lines insurer, but the policy is not covered
by the New Jersey Insurance Guaranty Fund, and only a policy of medical malpractice liability
insurance as defined in N.J.S.A. 17:30D-3d or a policy of property insurance covering owner-
occupied dwellings of less than four dwelling units are covered by the New Jersey Surplus Lines
Guaranty Fund.”
