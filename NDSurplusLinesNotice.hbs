            </div>

            <div class="content">
“Notice: 1. an insurer that is not licensed in this state is issuing the
insurance policy that you have applied to purchase. These
companies are called “nonadmitted” or “surplus lines” insurers. 2.
The insurer is not subject to the financial solvency regulation and
enforcement that applies to licensed insurers in this state. 3. These
insurers generally do not participate in insurance guaranty funds
created by state law. These guaranty funds will not pay your claims
or protect your assets if the insurer becomes insolvent and is unable
to make payments as promised. 4. Some states maintain lists of
approved or eligible surplus lines insurers and surplus lines
producers may use only insurers on the lists. Some states issue
orders that particular surplus lines insurers cannot be used. 5. For
additional information about the above matters and about the
insurer, you should ask questions of your insurance producer or
surplus lines producer. You may also contact your insurance
department consumer help line.”
